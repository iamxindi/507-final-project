# 507-final-project

Final Project Proposal 
For the final project, I’m going to crawl multiple pages in UXjobsboard and scrape data about UX jobs as well as companies offering them. I will create a database with two table, one with information about the job(title, company, posted date, etc) and another with information about the company(city, country, location,…)

Data source: 
https://www.uxjobsboard.com/

Presentation: 
An interactive command line prompt for user to choose data/visualization options. Display selected graphs using plotly. 

Visualization options are: 
Map: Companies plotted on map 
Bar chart: Number of job in each country
Job Posting trend (time)
Bubble chart: Full time/Contract and internship jobs 

Challenge score:  8 (Crawling [and scraping] multiple pages in a site you haven’t used before)
